        <h1>
          We have a responsibility to be skilled communicators.
        </h1>
      </div>
      <main class='pageStyle'>
        <p>
          A Communicative Engineer is someone that is able to understand and explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's someone that is able to take what they know and share it in a personalized way with anyone they're communicating with.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't just about technical topics, although that's a big part. Beyond the code and architecture, it's about understanding yourself and others, and being able to use that understanding in a beneficial way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is that most people struggle with communication. It leads to unfortunate misunderstandings, missed opportunities, and unnecessary stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to become a Communicative Engineer, and that's what this book is for.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will enable you to do the following...
        </p>

        <ul>
          {benefits.map(benefit => (
            <li>
              {benefit.text}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <p>
          The cool part is that all the benefits of purposeful, skilled communication will impact those around you just as strongly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Progress itself will compound as a community is built on a stronger foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>
          The Process
        </h2>
        <p>
          Getting better at communication is essentially the same as anything else. It takes a combination of time, intentionality, effort, and discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, if you want to get better at something and consistently try to, you will. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This book helps you along the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is intended to be a short guide filled with useful information and suggestions for your journey to becoming a Communicative Engineer.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Writing in Public
        </h2>
        <p>
          In truth, no one is the ultimate expert on this subject, least of all me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm working on this book as a way to collect my own thoughts and share them with others, but hopefully with some help.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I finish each stage of the book, I plan to publish as much as I can for direct feedback and editing suggestions. Ultimately I want to draw on the community of people that have built up an immesurable amount of collective experience and make sure I'm producing the best resource possible.
        </p>
        <p>
